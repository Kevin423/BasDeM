== Indentation, tabs, whitespaces ==
1. Use spaces, NOT tabs. Four of them.

Good:
public function setText($text) {
    $this->text = $text;
}

Bad:
public function setText($text) {
	$this->text = $text;
}

Tabs have a different width on each system.


2. We use whitespaces around boolean expressions.

Example:
if ( is_null($id) )


3. No spaces around function calls.

Example:
$tmp = Database::getMemplex($id);

== Documentation ==
We use Doxygen to generate our API documentation. 

=== PHP ===
Creating server documentation is quite simple. Just add a comment like

    /** A great short description.
     *
     * Followed by a longer description explaining important details.
     *
     * @param <type> <$parameter_name> Desription of a parameter. Add as many as you need.
     *
     * @return Say something about the return value. If it exists.
     */

right before every method and object declaration. Doxygen does the rest.
Doxygen adds all comments starting with "/** " to the docs.

The resulting documentation can be found in docs/api-server/ for the PHP written
server part and docs/api-client/ for the JavaScripted client side.

=== JS ===
The client, written in JavaScript, is a bit more tricky. Doxygen does not support
JavaScript out of the box. The workaround is a script that generates peudo-C++ code
Doxygen can understand. But that script requires a slightly different syntax:

    /** A great short description.
     *
     * Followed by a longer description explaining important details.
     *
     * @tparam <type> <parameter_name> Parameter description.
     * @treturn <type> Description of the return value.
     */

The complete syntax is documented at:

  http://jsunit.berlios.de/internal.html

Examples can be found in the jsUnit SVN repo:

  http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/jsunit/trunk/jsunit/

So can the script itself:
