== Indentation, tabs, whitespaces ==
1. Use spaces, NOT tabs. Four of them.

Good:
public function setText($text) {
    $this->text = $text;
}

Bad:
public function setText($text) {
	$this->text = $text;
}

Tabs have a different width on each system.


2. We use whitespaces around boolean expressions.

Example:
if ( is_null($id) )


3. No spaces around function calls.

Example:
$tmp = Database::getMemplex($id);

== Documentation ==
We use Doxygen to generate our API documentation. It's quite simple. Just add a comment like

    /** A great short description.
     *
     * Followed by a longer description explaining important details.
     *
     * @param type $name Desription of a parameter. Add as many as you need.
     *
     * @return Say something about the return value. If it exists.
     */

right before every public function and object declaration. Doxygen does the rest.
Doxygen adds all comments starting with "/** " to the docs.

The resulting documentation can be found in docs/api/.
