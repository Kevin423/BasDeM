== About BasDeM ==
When facing a decision in a project or in a political process you can 
distinguish between two phases: The forming of an opinion and the actual 
decision making.

The part of the process where you collect pros and cons to form an opinion 
is done first. The actual decision is subsequently done by voting.

Many tools like mailing lists, liquid democracy implementations
(like Liquid Feedback) and wikis don't distinguish between those
two phases and are therefore quite inconvenient for users. Who
has the time to follow a discussion covering dozens of pages?

BasDeM tries to solve this problem by only covering the first
part of decision making: forming of opinion. BasDeM is a tool
to collect arguments for and against a statement by active users
and to present them to everybody in a compact way. As a result
less active participants can easily get an overview over the
current state of a discussion.

The actual decision can then be done with different tools or at
a political party conference.

For details have a look at the BasDeM presentation by BasDeM
founder Justus Wingert (in German):

== Dependencies ==

=== Client ===
A modern web browser. We attempt to test BasDeM with

* Mozilla Firefox 10
* Opera 12
* Google Chrome 20

or later versions of these web browsers. Using the latest version
is highly recommended. We are ging to drop support for older
browsers once they are no longer supported by the manufacturer.

As BasDeM is using lots of modern web technologies there can
be problems when using Microsoft Internet Explorer. If you can
not avoid using it there might be some glitches in the user
interface. But things should still work, even if some parts
of BasDeM might look strange. Make sure to use at least version 9.


=== Server ===
* MySQL 5.5 or newer
* PHP 5.3 or newer
* PHP Data Objects (PDO, shipped with PHP since version 5.1)
* SHA512 (available since PHP 5.3.2) or similar hashing algorithm available for PHP
